Client
######

20.0.4
======
-Fixes Altitude Issues on VATSIM
-Time sync only occurs when Captains Clock button is pressed on glareshield to prevent weird MSFS2024 things happening with live weather.
-Requires WASM Aircraft V2.0.4

20.0.3
======
-Option added to Client Config File to disable TimeSync 

20.0.2
======
-Requires SU1
-Time Sync now works again following asobo bug fixes


20.0.1
======
-Rewritten WASM Module with 2024 SDK to improve performance
-Updated the Aircraft Config Files to match 2024
-All Lights now use MSFS2024 lighting and function correctly.
-WASM Module Freeze and Ground Altitude Functions now work correctly, no need to pause MSFS 2024 manually like we did in testing.
-New Setting in Configuration File option <AutomatedLoadIntoFlight> which can be set to true.  The Client will then monitor MSFS startup, activate the window and use keystrokes to load MSFS into a flight.  Only enable this when you have MSFS running as you want for example on a standalone PC.

20.0.0
======
-Standalone Installer so just extract ZIP file to any location so you can leave your 2020 version untouched
-Disables Time Sync as this breaks Weather and doesn't seem to set properly in 2024, recommend flying with RealTime/Real Weather set
-Recompiled in .NET9 for performance improvements
-Recompiled with latest MSFS SDK
